Feed 1 was a 3-sheet multifeed. Feed 2 was a 3-sheet multifeed. Feed 8 was a 2-sheet multifeed. Feed 11 was a 3-sheet multifeed. Feed 13 was a 2-sheet multifeed. Feed 16 was a 2-sheet multifeed. Feed 17 was a 2-sheet multifeed. Feed 18 was a 4-sheet multifeed, where there were 2 distinct 2-sheet slugs. Feed 19 was a 2-sheet multifeed. Feed 28 was a 2-sheet multifeed. Also of note - there were many damaged sheets, there is clear correlation between multifeeding and sheet damage. Also of note is that when sheets were damaged there was often an instance of sheet lift in the elevator - perhaps need some kind of minor tamping to eliminate this behavior?"}
